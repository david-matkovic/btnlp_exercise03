
Question 1:

a) 	$ uname -a
	MINGW64_NT-10.0-19045 UNIVW-NB380 3.4.9-be826601.x86_64 2023-09-07 12:36 UTC x86_64 Msys

b)	No, it's the second time I've used this OS. I did use it for the second NLP assignment as well.

c) 	No, I've got no questions that I would not be able to research on my own.


Question 2:

a) 	.bashrc is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. 
	It configures the environment for the user's shell session by setting aliases, functions, and other shell variables.

	.bash_profile is executed for login shells, where it often contains the same configurations as .bashrc but may
	additionally set up environment variables that need to be available for the entire session, like PATH or system-wide exports.


Question 3:

a)	"stdout" stands for standard output and is the default stream where a program writes its output data. "stderr" is the short for standard error and
	is a separate stream used to output error messages or diagnostics from the program. They are different because while stdout is used
	for regular program output, stderr is specifically for error messages, which allows them to be handled or redirected separately from other output. 


Question 4:

a)	dama010@UNIVW-NB380 MINGW64 ~/Desktop (new_branch)
	$ echo $((2+3))
	5

b) 	dama010@UNIVW-NB380 MINGW64 ~/Desktop (new_branch)
	echo “2+3” | bc
	5

c) 	dama010@UNIVW-NB380 MINGW64 ~/Desktop (new_branch)
	echo “2 3 + p” | dc
	5


Question 5:

a)	man: shows the manual page for other commands or programs.

b)	info: shows detailed documentation for commands or programs, which may include hyperlinked navigation.

c) 	type: Tells you how a command name is interpreted by the shell, whether it's an alias, a function, a built-in, or an external executable.

d)	which: finds the executable file associated with a given command in your PATH.

e)	stat: shows detailed info. about a particular file or filesystem.


Question 6:

		tail(used to display the last few lines of a text file or stream)
		wc(used to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file)
		cut(used to extract sections from each line of input)
		set(used to define environment options in a shell or script)
