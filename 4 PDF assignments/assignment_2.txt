Question 2:

a)	.gitignore is used to specify untracked files that Git should ignore. 
	And files already tracked by Git are not affected. It's usually used for log files, temporary files, 
	or build directoriesâ€”anything that we don't want to include in your repository.

b)	The correct time to push to a master/main branch is after we test and review our changes,
	(and ofc approve through a pull request).
