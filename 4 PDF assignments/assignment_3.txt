Question 1:

a)	the function name should be written with an underscore: my_function
	There should be no whitespace after the bracket and there shouold be one after the comma that
	separates the two arguments.
	I would personally add whitespace between the two arguments and the + sign in the return line

b)	numpy, pandas, os should all be have their own line code line preceded by import each time


Question 2:

a)	x, y, and z lack whitespace around the assignment operator

b)	return should be indented


Question 3:

a)	return should be indented

b)	needs an underscore: calculate_result  | needs whitespace between arguments and comma (arg1, arg2):
	the rest is fine.

Question 4:

a)	According to PEP 8, you should have one space on both sides of these operators (i.e., if x < 10 and y < 20):

b)	This one is fine ;D


Question 5:

a)	There should be a blank line between method_one and method_two

b)	the name of the function should be written like this calculate_result
