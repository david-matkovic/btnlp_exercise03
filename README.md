Assignment Completion Report: Tools for NLP Assignment 3

This README documents the completion of Tools for NLP Assignment 3. It focuses on various programming and Python concepts and which I later applied
to to a final project. The assignment consists of several exercises.

Here's an overview of what I've done:
.

1. Python Concepts
   - Worked with Matplotlib, Pandas, Regex.
   - Implemented data preprocessing and analysis tasks using these libraries.
   - Created visualizations using Matplotlib with the Pokemon dataset.

2. NLP Libraries
   - Explored NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim, and Textblob using a text excerpt from "Moby Dick".
   - Performed text tokenization, stop words filtering, lemmatization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.

3. Advanced Classes
   - Developed a "Calculator" class with basic arithmetic methods.
   - Extended functionality through a "Special" child class with additional methods like modulo and exponential.

4. Application
   - Conducted preliminary data cleaning on the twitter_training.csv dataset.
   - Employed various libraries for feature extraction and text transformations.

5. Class Creation
   - Created a class encapsulating the processes from Exercise 6.
   - Ensured the class could handle different data types and implemented fail-safes.
